# Riemann Sum Calculator

This might not be the best Riemann Sum Calculator ever created, but I assume it at least isn't the worst.

# Features

- Super high memory consumption
- Inefficient value calculation
- No interactivity
- Barely even accurate to a few decimal places

... and more!

# Usage

Prerequisites: ```numpy``` (install via ```pip install numpy```)

1) Clone the git repository onto your machine
2) ```cd riemann_sum_calculator``` and open in a text editor
3) Edit ```def f(x)``` to return your function using ```x```.
4) Edit ```main()``` to change the parameters sent to ```calc_sum```
5) Enjoy and prosper
6) (Optional) buy 128TB ram for higher precision calculations
